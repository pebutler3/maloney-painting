 <h2>About Us</h2>
 <p>Maloney Painting has been in business in Colorado for over 30 years. We are unique in that we maintain clean and sober paint crews. This is a rarity in the painting industry and we are proud to offer this promise.</p>
 <p>In 2014, Mike Maloney retired Maloney Painting and Decorating, Inc. His eldest son, Greg decided to continue his fatherâ€™s legacy and started Maloney Painting under the umbrella of his business, 303SiteMedics, LLC. We are proud to carry on the legacy of quality, craftsmanship and supreme customer service that Mike has created as a paint contractor for over three decades. We sleep good at night knowing we do our best in doing a better job for each job.</p>
  <p>In addition to painting, we are experts in drywall repair, trim and siding replacement and repair, deck and fence refinishing and more.</p>
  <p>We only use coatings that are compliant in the most stringent regulatory requirements. These products meet VOC (Volatile Organic Compound) guidelines for all applications. We primarily use Sherwin Williams for this purpose, but can work with other products to fit your needs. We are conscientious about our environment and will only use products that are proven safe for our environment and atmosphere.</p>
